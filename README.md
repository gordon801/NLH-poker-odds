# NLH Poker Odds Calculator

This program calculates the probability of a certain (No Limit Texas Hold'em) poker hand winning against another hand.

The results have been checked against a 3rd party program (https://www.pokerstrategy.com/poker-software-tools/equilab-holdem/) and determined to be reasonably correct. I've highlighted the relevant probabilities in the screenshots below (Draw % (program) â‰ˆ tie % * 2 (equilab))).

**Note: there is some variance in the python calculator's results due to a relatively low simulation number (50,000), which can be increased for less variance in result.**

**NB: Program logic and structure is scheduled to be refactored in the near future.**

## Program Structure
* Card.py: Class "Card" definitions and related functions.
* NLH_run.py: Generates one simulation of the board for two given hands.
* hand_finder.py: Algorithm to find the best 5-card hand from the board.
* Comparator.py: Function to compare two 5-card hands to determine the best hand.
* showdown.py: Generates all the simulations and keeps track of the number of wins and draws.
* run.py: Wrapper script that calls the other .py scripts and outputs the result.
