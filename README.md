# NLH Poker Odds Calculator

This program calculates the probability of a certain (No Limit Texas Hold'em) poker hand winning against another hand.

The results have been checked against a 3rd party program (https://www.pokerstrategy.com/poker-software-tools/equilab-holdem/) and determined to be reasonably correct.

**Note: there is some variance in the python calculator's results due to a relatively low simulation number (50,000), which can be increased for less variance in result.**
